          <p class="design-text">
            Human hands have a great potential for holding and
            manipulating different objects in a dexterous way,
            a skill that can be acquired by training. Therefore,
            a multi-fingered robot hand can provide a great chance to achieve such dexterity
            in a robotic system, as well as the ability to explore, touch and get the perception
            of physical properties, such as temperature, weight, etc (Melchiorri and Kaneko, 2008,
            pp.345&dash;360).

        <p class="design-text">
          Given the importance of the human hand’s functions, there has always been a great
          interest shown in capturing and replicating the complexity of a hand,
          and science and engineering have been trying to match the hand’s functions and reproduce
          artificial robotic hands for decades. An example is Shadow Dexterous Hand which can be found in Figure 1.
          Even though many researchers have been focusing on this subject,
          there are a limited number of real-world applications in the robotics industry. Artificial hands show great
          potential in many different domains, such as prosthetics, assistive robotics, supervised manipulation, teleoperation, etc. (Piazza et al., 2019).

          Based on the research conducted by Piazza et al. (2019), four different types of joints were identified (Figure 2):

            <li>Rigid: a system connected by fixed mechanical elements.</li>
            <li>Flexible: a system having the links connected using flexible elements.</li>

          The main objective of this project is to create a robotic hand that can replicate the flexibility,
          and various degrees of freedom of a human hand, as well as its appearance. This portfolio will discuss
          and analyse the development process, outlining the key steps and the decisions made through the process,
          along with the reasoning behind them. The main focus will be on designing and creating the robotic artificial skin,
          the decisions that led to choosing the materials and the techniques used.

          <h3 class="design-subtitle">3.1. 3D Scanning</h3>
          <p class="design-subtext">
            3D scanning is a technology used for designing and
            inspecting a physical model, by converting it into digital
            3D Computer-Aided Design (CAD) using various scanning
            software. Then, the virtual image can be studied in depth,
            modified, stored, or printed, which allows preparing for
            production by ensuring that the initial vision has been
            realised as intended, as Javaid et al. (2021) describes in
            their research paper. Once the scanning is done, the CAD
            file can be exported into different file formats, such as
            Standard Triangulate Language (STL). 3D scanning uses
            advanced software for precise measurement and storage to
            help increase the process flexibility and reliability and it
            can be used in numerous domains, such as reverse
            engineering, education, architecture, healthcare, industrial
            tools development, quality monitoring, prototyping, etc.,
            allowing to use different software such as “Colin 3D, Artec
            Studio, PolyWorks, Inspect Plus and Volume Graphics” (Javaid
            et al., 2021). <br><br>For this project, the 3D scanning tool was
            considered to scan, and later 3D print, the internal
            structure of the hand. Below, the scan of the hand can be
            found and it should be mentioned that some imperfections can
            be observed due to the real hand&apos;s movement.

          <p class="design-subtext">
            3D printing is a technology that allows the creation of
            physical objects by adding material successively and it can
            be used for improving the manufacturing process&apos;s efficiency
            in various sectors, such as healthcare, automotive and
            aerospace industries, agriculture, and many others. The
            three-dimensional structure can be printed from
            Computer-Aided Design designs (Shahrubudin, Lee and Ramlan,
            2019).<br><br>
            For this project, it was proposed to print the internal
            structure for the prototype (Figure 6).

            3.3. Skin materials and production
          </h3>
          <p class="design-subtext">
            According to the research conducted by Cirillo, Cirillo and
            Pirozzi (2012), the decisions regarding the development of
            artificial skin should be made based on a set of
            requirements, some of the most important ones being high
            scalability, fast response, light-weight, low cost, low
            power consumption and ability to apply the skin to different
            curved surfaces, therefore high conformability. This section
            will discuss some of the most common materials and
            techniques used in the industry to imitate human skin,
            mentioning some of their advantages and disadvantages.

            Even though cell cultures (reproduction of human skin cells
            in vitro) simulating skin are available and are being
            researched further, they are expensive, and hard to store
            and work with. Therefore, the analysis performed by
            Dąbrowska et al. (2015) shows that most of the time, “the
            materials used to imitate human skin are gelatinous
            substances, elastomers, epoxy resin, liquid suspensions and
            even metals and textiles“. Usually, skin models are used
            for testing, teaching, calibration, etc. and using
            biologically inactive materials is preferred to using
            biologically active materials, as they are more reliable and
            durable, cheaper and, also, they are cheaper and easier to
            store and work with, as previously mentioned, and the
            synthetic skin does not raise ethical issues, which is an
            essential point to consider (Dąbrowska et al., 2015).

            As with most development processes, the skin development
            process usually consists of four phases as well: defining
            requirements, choosing materials, manufacturing, and
            evaluation. When choosing the materials to be used, it is
            important to consider a few requirements such as cost,
            durability, environmental impact, and practicality, as well
            as the purpose of manufacturing a skin model and the
            properties and functions wanted (Dąbrowska et al., 2015).

            4.1. Moulding the hand
          </h3>
          <p class="design-subtext">
            The first step of creating the skin is casting the hand.
            This is realised by using Chromatic Moulding Alginate
            material, a powder that is ideal for casting body parts, and
            once mixed with water, it takes around 3-4 minutes to set
            (Figure 7).

          <p class="design-subtext">
            Before casting the hand, it is necessary to grease the body
            part with an oily agent to protect the hand, making it
            simpler to be removed and prevent the mould from being
            disturbed. Once this is done, the moulding material is mixed
            with water until smooth and the hand can be inserted into
            the mixture for approximately two minutes. Once the alginate
            is set, the hand can be carefully removed. This process,
            together with the result, can be visualised in Figures 8, 9
            and 10.

            The final phase represents skin manufacturing. The material
            used to cast the skin is Platsil Gel 00 silicone, pigment
            and lighter fluid (Figure 22). Before pouring the silicone,
            the mould has to be very well cleaned with a special
            solution for cleaning mould, named “MC 1 Mould Cleaner”
            (Figure 22).

            Additionally, the internal structure must be covered with a
            special non-sticky tape: soft foam underwrap (Figure 23), a
            pre-wrap tape that ensures that the silicone sticks to the
            internal structure. This phase can be found in Figure 24.

            The silicone pouring phase is divided in two steps as it
            will be poured in two coats. Once the materials are
            prepared, the two-part silicone can be mixed with the
            pigment in a small quantity, and lighter fluid should be
            added to the mixture, as it helps the material flow better
            in the skinning process. The two parts of the mould are
            coated and well covered with silicone, as well as the
            internal structure, as shown in Figure 25 and Figure 26.

            After approximately an hour, when the silicone is cured, a
            larger amount of silicone can be mixed with a substance
            called “deadener”, which is used to simulate the look and
            feel of skin (Figure 27). To hold the mould together, two
            clumps are used and the silicone can be poured into the
            mould containing the internal structure (Figure 28).

            To enhance the aesthetic appeal, the silicone excess has been removed and artificial nails have been attached. To do this, fake nails have been purchased and to suit the hand appearance, the nails have been filed and shortened. Finally, the ultimate form of the model hand can be found in Figure 30 and Figure 31.

      The final artefact meets all requirements defined in the design phase, 
      regarding skin, as the colour and texture are appropriate. 
      The fingers can be bent, but because there were wires used for the internal structure, 
      the fingers can bend backwards, which ideally should not happen, as it is not natural 
      for a human hand to bend this way, therefore this aspect could be improved by redesigning the internal structure of the hand in the future. 
      </p>
      <p class="design-text">
      The appearance of the final artefact could be improved to make the model hand’s surface smoother, by using a silicone smoothing agent and once cured, a silicone finish can be applied. The model can be painted to represent veins and other details to improve the presentation of the model.
